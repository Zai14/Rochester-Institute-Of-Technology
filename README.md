# Student Engagement Analytics Using Data Science and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project was developed for the **Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)** and the **Excelerate Early Internship**. The goal was to analyze student engagement patterns using data science and machine learning techniques, providing insights into retention and churn behavior. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and a recommendation system to enhance student retention.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned datasets, handled missing values, and engineered new features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized trends in sign-ups, completions, and engagement using charts and plots.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implemented a Random Forest Classifier to predict student retention with 85% accuracy.
- **Recommendation System:** Built using IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to suggest personalized engagement strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models.
- **Cosine Similarity** and **IDF Vectorization** for recommendations.

## Installation

## Results
**85% accuracy in student retention prediction using the Random Forest Classifier.**
**Identified key factors influencing retention: completion time, age, and signup date.**
**Developed a recommendation system to improve engagement based on personalized analysis.**
## Learnings
**This project helped strengthen my skills in data science, machine learning, and recommendation systems. I gained valuable experience in feature engineering, EDA, and predictive modeling, all while contributing to real-world insights for student retention.**
